# Doge Twitter Image Proxy

Doge.gov is a terrible website and it shows. This repository hosts a simple webpage that allows you to proxy practically any Twitter/X direct image URL over the official `doge.gov` website using an internal image scaling API. It processes entirely in your browser, but you are responsible for what you do with it.
